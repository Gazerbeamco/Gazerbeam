This week, I celebrated Halloween a little early by watching a movie I had never seen before, “Halloween.” I am not big on slasher films, in fact I’ve avoided them for most of my life. I have watched parts of the original “Nightmare on Elm Street,” and I watched the remake on DVD only a few years ago at a friend’s house. I’m fairly sure that I’ve flipped past parts of “Halloween II” while changing channels on television set. But, I had never invested time into actually watching it.

Two things that piqued my interest lately was a behind the scenes commentary on the history of the Halloween series of films. Once I had learned a little bit more, I wanted to get the full experience.

So, I fired up my AMC app on iPad and found that “Halloween” was available for watching on demand. I’m aware that this is most likely the “edited for TV,” PG-14 version of the film, but that’s still enough for me to get the “gist” of what the movie is about. Besides, I had learned that the first movie wasn’t actually very gory.

So, to summarize the plot of the film, there is a scene at the very beginning from 1963 where young Michael Meyers’ sister, who I guess was responsible for watching him at the time, was fooling around with her boy friend. But, Michael is watching from outside through a window, and after the boyfriend leaves, he grabs a steak knife and really without any explanation walks up stairs and brutally kills his sister by stabbing her to death. But, not without first stopping to put on a clown mask, I guess.

Then, he wanders outside just as his parents pull up, and everybody standing around staring at him as if they are about to shout, “What did you do, this time, Michael?” Somehow, I don’t think that this behavior could be dismissed as “boys will be boys.”

Fast forward fifteen years, and MIchael’s psychologist is on his way to the mental hospital where he is being kept to retrieve him for some kind of examination. His nurse companion is driving and on the way they have a conversation about how dangerous Michael Meyers is. Dr. Loomis says that Meyers is pure evil.

They pull up to the gate that’s outside of the mental hospital. They see that there are patients roaming around next to the road. The nurse makes a crack that is something along the lines of, “Do they just let them outside to roam around now?” Of course, Dr. Loomis is very alarmed, thinking that Michael has gotten out. He gets out of the car and heads for the guardhouse, but one of the patients jumps on top of the car and tries to grab at the nurse. She panics, and dives to safety. But, this allows the patient--Michael Meyers, I presume--to jump in the car and just drive away.

Meyers spends the rest of the movie driving around and playing “peek-a-boo” with our main group of characters, who are all high school girls. There is some tension, because you kind of know that he is out there, but I kept wondering how hard it would have been for anybody to drive a car with that mask on. And, whenever he is close up to the camera, he wheezes as if he can breath with the mask on. Even when he is in pursuit of his next victim, he can’t move very fast, possibly due to the fact that he is wearing a heavy rubber mask.

The one thing that makes the movie is the score. Without it, I think that there would be much less tension. But, of course, the theme for “Halloween’ is so iconic now, that just hearing it on its own is enough to make anybody feel tense. The thing with Meyers, though, is the theme music starts as soon as he appears on screen, so it can be a little distracting. During scenes when he is driving around in the sudan from the hospital, it’s almost as if he is playing the music on the car’s radio. Or, 8-track.

So, Dr. Loomis ends up catching up with him in time to stop him from claiming his last victim, Lori Stroud. The doctor takes down Meyers by shooting him six times in the chest. Then, the killer falls backwards, over a balcony, and then onto the ground two stories down. This is after he has been stabbed in the neck with a knitting needle, and in the eye with a coat hanger. Somehow, though, he even survives the fall.

Jamie Lee Curtis’ friend gets stuck in the window of her neighbors’ laundry room when she tries to get out after she is locked inside. How does one get locked inside a room from the inside? I’m not sure. Even the nine-year-old who she was supposed to be watching was able to unlock the door. The reason why she was doing the laundry was because she spilled butter on her shirt while she was popping popcorn on the stove.

There are a lot of fun reminders in the movie of what life was like in the 1970’s, before things like VCR’s, or the Internet. For example, I remember making popcorn with an air popper before there was microwaveable popcorn. We might have popped popcorn on the stove, but that was rare.

I had also forgotten what the old-fashioned phones sounded like. Or, how long it took to dial a rotary phones. Five percent of the movie is people either answering the phone, or slowly dialing a number and then waiting for the other person to pick up. This seemed so strange to me, but then I realized that this was before answering machines, call waiting, or voice mail.

So, I ended up watching a movie that was meant to be scary, but I was never really that scared or grossed out. I mean, sure, I’m older now and the style of violence is outdated compared to the modern slasher. I’m sure that the original is super tame compared to the remake that was recently released in theaters. I feel like the most interesting parts involved the other characters, and then every once in a while Michael would pop up to remind us that it is a horror movie. There are plenty of deaths towards the end, but barely any blood. Not that I’m complaining.

I was reminded, retroactively I suppose, of “IT Follows.” I know that this movie drew a lot of inspiration from different John Carpenter movies. The whole idea of a curse that’s passed by having sex with someone, and an entity that follows you until it kills you is actually quite a lot like Michael Meyers from the “Halloween” movies. I think that “IT Follows” improves on the concept, though, because its “bogeyman” takes different forms, so it can actually be anything. This heightens the tension in the movie. It also doesn’t seem to be able to operate vehicles, which I think is probably a good thing.

So, I am glad that I was able to see the movie “Halloween.” But, I will not be back for second viewings. I would rather spend my time watching the sequel, “Halloween II.” Or, at least that’s what I thought until last night when I watched the sequel.

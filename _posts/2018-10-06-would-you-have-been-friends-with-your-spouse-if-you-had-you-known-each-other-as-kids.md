My guess is that unless a couple were high school sweethearts, that they only met after they graduated high school or even later on after they became adults.

I met my wife in college, so I don’t know how she was in middle or high school. And, more importantly, she doesn’t know what I was like when I was younger. She had also been attending college for a year when I met her, so she had more time to mature. So, we were both very different people compared to how we were as kids or teenagers.

My hunch is that we would have walked different circles and followed different paths.

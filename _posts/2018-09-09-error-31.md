A simple research project has taken a turn for the worse today. In April, at the suggestion of a friend I purchased a Sony Digital Handycam for about $3. Purchases of used electronics at a garage sale--computers, cameras, video cameras, TVs--are always a huge risk, because even if they work when you get home with them, they could die at any time after that. But, then, even a brand-new device can turn out to be faulty, so maybe there is always some degree of risk.

The camcorder, though, was a fixer-up in the sense that it came with only an A/V cable. But, I had some credit on Amazon, so I right away ordered an A/C adapter. Once that arrived, I was able to plug the camera in and charge the battery. We even discovered that there were some videos left on its hard drive.

Despite my initial doubts, it was beginning to look like this purchase would be a really good thing. My goal was to have it ready in time for Kayla’s graduation in June so I would be able to record with it.

As we got closer to June, the one question that remained was how I was going to transfer the videos off of the camcorder and onto my computer where they could be edited or shared on YouTube. Smartphones are so much more convenient than camcorders, so after so many years of owning an iPhone I had really forgotten how clunky and proprietary camcorders could be.

I did some research initially, and concluded that I would need either a memory card or a USB cable adapter. I ordered the cable first, but when I tried it my computer told me that the camcorder was an “invalid device.” The only information I could find on Sony’s website about any drivers I might need for the handycam said that I didn’t need to download drivers, that Windows should have everything I needed. So, I was pretty much stuck.

Things kind of stayed that way until recently when I made another gamble and ordered a Sony DUO memory card. It arrived yesterday, and I happily began trying it out with the camcorder last night. It fit, things were working, and now all I needed to do was to figure out how to transfer videos to the card.

That’s brings me to today, when I had been putting every effort into finally and ultimately getting the videos off of the camcorder. It wasn’t just a matter of retrieving my daughter’s graduation ceremony. Elijah’s preschool picnic, and video from my niece’s wedding were on there too. Getting them off would have been a slam dunk.

I tried all of the same tricks that I’ve tried before. Card, USB cable.

A few weeks ago, a co-worker had given us an old Windows XP computer that they didn’t need any more. We had set it up inside Josh’s room, and he had messed around with it a little bit. I decided that if my computer wouldn’t talk to the camcorder, then maybe the XP Windows machine would be more its speed.

Again, I tried connecting to it with the cable, looked up any drivers I could update on Windows XP (no surprise, that Windows XP isn’t supported by the needed software). I think that something happened, though, while I was feverishly working to get the two devices to talk to each other, because the next time that I looked at the camcorder, it had shut off and wasn’t turning on when I flipped the on switch.

I thought that maybe the battery had run down (which would be strange) so I plugged it into the wall and jiggered it a little bit longer. Then, it switched on, but instead of giving me its usual, happy news of being ready to take videos or play back the videos that were in memory, it gave me a “Error 31” message.

Error 31?

Slowly, I’ve reached the conclusion that “Error 31” is basically the blue screen of death for Sony Handycams. And, I feel so horrible that after so much work, and after having the videos just a button push away only a couple of hours ago, that everything that I was trying to preserve is suddenly gone forever.

I’m not quite sure what happened. Perhaps when I unplugged it from the computer when I was making another attempt, or during a reboot, or maybe from turning it on or off so much. There is nothing that I did which stands out as “the moment” that the hard drive failed.

So, now I am the not-so-proud owner of a brain-dead Sony Handycam as well as the former owner of videos which had represented three of my fondest memories from the last four months. Fortunately I had taken photos and videos with my camera and phone, so this isn’t a complete loss. But, in many cases the videos offered a unique perspective of things that had happened, and I had been looking forward to watching more of them, as well as sharing them.

I also have this nagging feeling that if I had not even tried to grab the videos, then the camcorder would still be working. Perhaps I <i>did </i>make a mistake that caused the failure, or maybe a countdown had already started and the camcorder was doomed to fail eventually. Either way, I wouldn’t have wanted the only copies of the videos to remain there. So, it wasn’t my choice as to whether or not I needed to try to transfer the videos. And, maybe I was never meant to have them.

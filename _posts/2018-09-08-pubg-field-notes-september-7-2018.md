<h2>PUBG Field Notes</h2>
<h2>September 7, 2018</h2>
I played a few rounds of PUBG tonight. During the first round, my team and I landed in the center of Pochinki. Unfortunately, so did several other teams. We were taken out pretty quickly. I was hoping to engaging some enemies, when I came upon two of them across the street. They bore down on me. I knocked one out just before the other knocked me out. Then the second guy was knocked out. But, my teammate who came to my rescue, he was also knocked out.

So, for a minute or so there was just the four of us crawling on our hands and knees, slowly dying.

During the last match, I landed in a duo. Inside Pochinki. My partner and I searched the neighborhood for loot. Things were going well, when I suddenly realized that he had dropped out. I finished my looting, and then headed out. I found a vehicle--a buggy, and made my way slowly into the center of the map.

I made it onto the hill outside of the school and managed two gun down two people. The end came when I thought I had found the perfect house to camp at, when suddenly I was being fired upon and of course learned that somebody else was already camping there.
